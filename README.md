# A1travel Design Files
Im slowly adding some of my UI templates that I did whilst I was working for Chadwell Travel Ltd. (trading as a1travel.com) before it's unfortunate collapse in October of 2017.
I'll add segments of the UI first before any full pages.

# Holiday Search:

This was the main responsive search form displayed on the homepage.
The company wanted all of the search fields to be contained in a single row on desktop, so a floating UI was added for room and party selection which became an expandable element in mobile.

# Responsive Product Filter UI:

Fully responsive with: -
1. Slide-in multi-level product filter for mobile which expands to a full visible sidebar in desktop based on standard design principles. Complete with count indicators (desktop) for collapsed filter groups to assist users in visually identifying that X number of filters are applied to a group.
2. Simplified product in mobile view with a focus on image and price that expands to a tabbed interface in desktop, including image gallery and tripadvisor info.
3. slide-in search form in mobile which expands to full-with in desktop and sits at the top of the page to both aid users in seeing current search terms. Room and persons interface expands on click to allow for room number required and child information
