# A1travel Design Files
Im slowly adding some of my UI templates that I did whilst I was working for Chadwell Travel Ltd. (trading as a1travel.com) before it's unfortunate collapse in October of 2017.
I'll add segments of the UI first before any full pages.

# Holiday Search:

This was the main responsive search form displayed on the homepage.
The company wanted all of the search fields to be contained in a single row on desktop, so a floating UI was added for room and party selection which became an expandable element in mobile.

# Responsive Product Filter UI:

<strong>Desktop Version:</strong>
<p>
Adopts a standard-design collapsible filter. If a category is collapsed, we show a little indicator to display a count of all checked elements in the category to serve as a visual aid to inform users that there are checked items.
</p>

<strong>Mobile Version:</strong>
<p>Filter initially hidden off-canvas and slides in on button click event.</p>
<p>Slide panel lists only product categories and any checked products are listed below. (the list of checked item values would be done by the dev team)<p>
<p>Clicking a category would activate another slide-in element to display it's child products for selection.<p>
<p>The idea was that we separate filterable products into easier to digest chunks in mobile, rather than display one long list as per the desktop version.
